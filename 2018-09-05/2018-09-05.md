```cpp
if(prop === "tracks" && value !== ""){
    if(collection[id][prop]){
      collection[id][prop].push(value);
    }else{
      collection[id][prop] = [value];
    }
  }else if(value !== "") {

  }else{
    delete collection[id][prop];
  }

  **If prop isn't "tracks" and value isn't empty (""), update or set the value for that record album's property.

  If prop is "tracks" but the album doesn't have a "tracks" property, create an empty array before adding the new value to the album's corresponding property.

  If prop is "tracks" and value isn't empty (""), push the value onto the end of the album's existing tracks array.

  If value is empty (""), delete the given prop property from the album.**
